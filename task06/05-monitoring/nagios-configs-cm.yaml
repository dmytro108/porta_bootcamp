    # CGI.CFG - Sample CGI Configuration File for Nagios 4.5.9
    #
    #
    #################################################################


    # MAIN CONFIGURATION FILE
    # This tells the CGIs where to find your main configuration file.
    # The CGIs will read the main and host config files for any other
    # data they might need.

    main_config_file=/opt/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg



    # PHYSICAL HTML PATH
    # This is the path where the HTML files for Nagios reside.  This
    # value is used to locate the logo images needed by the statusmap
    # and statuswrl CGIs.

    physical_html_path=/opt/nagios/share



    # URL HTML PATH
    # This is the path portion of the URL that corresponds to the
    # physical location of the Nagios HTML files (as defined above).
    # This value is used by the CGIs to locate the online documentation
    # and graphics.  If you access the Nagios pages with an URL like
    # http://www.myhost.com/nagios, this value should be '/nagios'
    # (without the quotes).

    url_html_path=/nagios



    # CONTEXT-SENSITIVE HELP
    # This option determines whether or not a context-sensitive
    # help icon will be displayed for most of the CGIs.
    # Values: 0 = disables context-sensitive help
    #         1 = enables context-sensitive help

    show_context_help=0



    # PENDING STATES OPTION
    # This option determines what states should be displayed in the web
    # interface for hosts/services that have not yet been checked.
    # Values: 0 = leave hosts/services that have not been check yet in their original state
    #         1 = mark hosts/services that have not been checked yet as PENDING

    use_pending_states=1



    # AUTHENTICATION USAGE
    # This option controls whether or not the CGIs will use any
    # authentication when displaying host and service information, as
    # well as committing commands to Nagios for processing.
    #
    # Read the HTML documentation to learn how the authorization works!
    #
    # NOTE: It is a really *bad* idea to disable authorization, unless
    # you plan on removing the command CGI (cmd.cgi)!  Failure to do
    # so will leave you wide open to kiddies messing with Nagios and
    # possibly hitting you with a denial of service attack by filling up
    # your drive by continuously writing to your command file!
    #
    # Setting this value to 0 will cause the CGIs to *not* use
    # authentication (bad idea), while any other value will make them
    # use the authentication functions (the default).

    use_authentication=1



    # x509 CERT AUTHENTICATION
    # When enabled, this option allows you to use x509 cert (SSL)
    # authentication in the CGIs.  This is an advanced option and should
    # not be enabled unless you know what you're doing.

    use_ssl_authentication=0



    # DEFAULT USER
    # Setting this variable will define a default user name that can
    # access pages without authentication.  This allows people within a
    # secure domain (i.e., behind a firewall) to see the current status
    # without authenticating.  You may want to use this to avoid basic
    # authentication if you are not using a secure server since basic
    # authentication transmits passwords in the clear.
    #
    # Important:  Do not define a default username unless you are
    # running a secure web server and are sure that everyone who has
    # access to the CGIs has been authenticated in some manner!  If you
    # define this variable, anyone who has not authenticated to the web
    # server will inherit all rights you assign to this user!

    #default_user_name=guest



    # SYSTEM/PROCESS INFORMATION ACCESS
    # This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
    # have access to viewing the Nagios process information as
    # provided by the Extended Information CGI (extinfo.cgi).  By
    # default, *no one* has access to this unless you choose to
    # not use authorization.  You may use an asterisk (*) to
    # authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.

    authorized_for_system_information=admin



    # CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ACCESS
    # This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
    # can view ALL configuration information (hosts, commands, etc).
    # By default, users can only view configuration information
    # for the hosts and services they are contacts for. You may use
    # an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has authenticated
    # to the web server.

    authorized_for_configuration_information=admin



    # SYSTEM/PROCESS COMMAND ACCESS
    # This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
    # can issue shutdown and restart commands to Nagios via the
    # command CGI (cmd.cgi).  Users in this list can also change
    # the program mode to active or standby. By default, *no one*
    # has access to this unless you choose to not use authorization.
    # You may use an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has
    # authenticated to the web server.

    authorized_for_system_commands=admin



    # GLOBAL HOST/SERVICE VIEW ACCESS
    # These two options are comma-delimited lists of all usernames that
    # can view information for all hosts and services that are being
    # monitored.  By default, users can only view information
    # for hosts or services that they are contacts for (unless you
    # you choose to not use authorization). You may use an asterisk (*)
    # to authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.

    authorized_for_all_services=admin
    authorized_for_all_hosts=admin



    # GLOBAL HOST/SERVICE COMMAND ACCESS
    # These two options are comma-delimited lists of all usernames that
    # can issue host or service related commands via the command
    # CGI (cmd.cgi) for all hosts and services that are being monitored.
    # By default, users can only issue commands for hosts or services
    # that they are contacts for (unless you choose to not use
    # authorization).  You may use an asterisk (*) to authorize any
    # user who has authenticated to the web server.

    authorized_for_all_service_commands=admin
    authorized_for_all_host_commands=admin



    # READ-ONLY USERS
    # A comma-delimited list of usernames that have read-only rights in
    # the CGIs.  This will block any service or host commands normally shown
    # on the extinfo CGI pages.  It will also block comments from being shown
    # to read-only users.

    #authorized_for_read_only=user1,user2



    # STATUSMAP BACKGROUND IMAGE
    # This option allows you to specify an image to be used as a
    # background in the statusmap CGI.  It is assumed that the image
    # resides in the HTML images path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share/images).
    # This path is automatically determined by appending "/images"
    # to the path specified by the 'physical_html_path' directive.
    # Note:  The image file may be in GIF, PNG, JPEG, or GD2 format.
    # However, I recommend that you convert your image to GD2 format
    # (uncompressed) but ONLY IF YOU WILL USE THE LEGACY MAP EXCLUSIVELY,
    # as this will cause less CPU load when the CGI generates the image.

    #statusmap_background_image=smbackground.gd2



    # STATUSMAP TRANSPARENCY INDEX COLOR
    # These options set the r,g,b values of the background color used the statusmap CGI,
    # so normal browsers that can't show real png transparency set the desired color as
    # a background color instead (to make it look pretty).
    # Defaults to white: (R,G,B) = (255,255,255).

    #color_transparency_index_r=255
    #color_transparency_index_g=255
    #color_transparency_index_b=255



    # DEFAULT STATUSMAP LAYOUT METHOD
    # This option allows you to specify the default layout method
    # the statusmap CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you do
    # not use this option, the default for the legacy map is to use
    # user-defined coordinates and the default for the new map is "6"
    # (Circular Balloon).
    # Valid options for the legacy map are as follows:
    #	0 = User-defined coordinates
    #	1 = Depth layers
    #	2 = Collapsed tree
    #	3 = Balanced tree
    #	4 = Circular
    #	5 = Circular (Marked Up)
    # Valid options for the new map are as follows:
    #	0 = User-defined coordinates
    #	1 = Depth Layers (Horizontal)
    #	2 = Collapsed tree (Horizontal)
    #	3 = Balanced tree (Horizontal)
    #	4 = DON'T USE
    #	5 = Circular Markup
    #	6 = Circular Balloon
    #	7 = Balanced tree (Vertical)
    #	8 = Collapsed tree (Vertical)
    #	9 = Depth Layers (Vertical)
    #	10 = Force Map

    #default_statusmap_layout=6



    # DEFAULT STATUSWRL LAYOUT METHOD
    # This option allows you to specify the default layout method
    # the statuswrl (VRML) CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you
    # do not use this option, the default is to use user-defined
    # coordinates.  Valid options are as follows:
    #	0 = User-defined coordinates
    #       2 = Collapsed tree
    #       3 = Balanced tree
    #       4 = Circular

    default_statuswrl_layout=4



    # STATUSWRL INCLUDE
    # This option allows you to include your own objects in the
    # generated VRML world.  It is assumed that the file
    # resides in the HTML path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share).

    #statuswrl_include=myworld.wrl



    # PING SYNTAX
    # This option determines what syntax should be used when
    # attempting to ping a host from the WAP interface (using
    # the statuswml CGI.  You must include the full path to
    # the ping binary, along with all required options.  The
    # $HOSTADDRESS$ macro is substituted with the address of
    # the host before the command is executed.
    # Please note that the syntax for the ping binary is
    # notorious for being different on virtually ever *NIX
    # OS and distribution, so you may have to tweak this to
    # work on your system.

    ping_syntax=/bin/ping -n -U -c 5 $HOSTADDRESS$



    # REFRESH RATE
    # This option allows you to specify the refresh rate in seconds
    # of various CGIs (status, statusmap, extinfo, and outages).

    refresh_rate=90



    # PAGE TOUR
    # Enable page tour for helpful tips and tricks on various pages

    #enable_page_tour=1



    # DEFAULT PAGE LIMIT
    # This option allows you to specify the default number of results
    # displayed on the status.cgi.  This number can be adjusted from
    # within the UI after the initial page load. Setting this to 0
    # will show all results.

    result_limit=100



    # ESCAPE HTML TAGS
    # This option determines whether HTML tags in host and service
    # status output is escaped in the web interface.  If enabled,
    # your plugin output will not be able to contain clickable links.

    escape_html_tags=1



    # SOUND OPTIONS
    # These options allow you to specify an optional audio file
    # that should be played in your browser window when there are
    # problems on the network.  The audio files are used only in
    # the status CGI.  Only the sound for the most critical problem
    # will be played.  Order of importance (higher to lower) is as
    # follows: unreachable hosts, down hosts, critical services,
    # warning services, and unknown services. If there are no
    # visible problems, the sound file optionally specified by
    # 'normal_sound' variable will be played.
    #
    #
    # <varname>=<sound_file>
    #
    # Note: All audio files must be placed in the /media subdirectory
    # under the HTML path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share/media/).

    #host_unreachable_sound=hostdown.wav
    #host_down_sound=hostdown.wav

    # action URLs will open.

    action_url_target=_blank
    notes_url_target=_blank



    # LOCK AUTHOR NAMES OPTION
    # This option determines whether users can change the author name
    # when submitting comments, scheduling downtime.  If disabled, the
    # author names will be locked into their contact name, as defined in Nagios.
    # Values: 0 = allow editing author names
    #         1 = lock author names (disallow editing)

    lock_author_names=1



    # SPLUNK INTEGRATION OPTIONS
    # These options allow you to enable integration with Splunk
    # in the web interface.  If enabled, you'll be presented with
    # "Splunk It" links in various places in the CGIs (log file,
    # alert history, host/service detail, etc).  Useful if you're
    # trying to research why a particular problem occurred.
    # For more information on Splunk, visit http://www.splunk.com/

    # This option determines whether the Splunk integration is enabled
    # Values: 0 = disable Splunk integration
    #         1 = enable Splunk integration

    #enable_splunk_integration=1

    # This option should be the URL used to access your instance of Splunk
    #splunk_url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/



    # NAVIGATION BAR SEARCH OPTIONS
    # The following options allow to configure the navbar search. Default
    # is to search for hostnames. With enabled navbar_search_for_addresses,
    # the navbar search queries IP addresses as well. It's also possible
    # to enable search for aliases by setting navbar_search_for_aliases=1.

    # be unchecked.

    #ack_no_sticky=0
    #ack_no_send=0



    # SHOW ONLY HARD STATES IS TACTICAL OVERVIEW
    # This option controls whether only HARD states are counted on the
    # Tactical Overview, or if both HARD and SOFT states are counted.
    # Set to 1 to show only HARD states. Defaults to 0 (HARD+SOFT).

    #tac_cgi_hard_only=0



    # COMMAND COMMENTS
    # These options control whether or not comments are required, optional,
    # or not allowed for specific commands. The format for each line is:

    # NAGIOS.CFG - Sample Main Config File for Nagios 4.5.9

    #

    # Read the documentation for more information on this configuration

    # file.  I've provided some comments here, but things may not be so

    # clear without further explanation.

    #

    #

    ##############################################################################



    # LOG FILE

    # This is the main log file where service and host events are logged

    # for historical purposes.  This should be the first option specified

    # in the config file!!!


    log_file=/opt/nagios/var/nagios.log




    # OBJECT CONFIGURATION FILE(S)

    # These are the object configuration files in which you define hosts,

    # host groups, contacts, contact groups, services, etc.

    # You can split your object definitions across several config files

    # if you wish (as shown below), or keep them all in a single config file.


    # You can specify individual object config files as shown below:

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/timeperiods.cfg

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/templates.cfg


    # Definitions for monitoring the local (Linux) host

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/nagios.cfg

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/apache.cfg

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/mysql_master.cfg

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/mysql_slave.cfg

    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/host.cfg


    cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/hostgroups.cfg


    # Definitions for monitoring a Windows machine

    #cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/windows.cfg


    # Definitions for monitoring a router/switch

    #cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/switch.cfg


    # Definitions for monitoring a network printer

    #cfg_file=/opt/nagios/etc/objects/printer.cfg



    # You can also tell Nagios to process all config files (with a .cfg

    # extension) in a particular directory by using the cfg_dir

    # directive as shown below:


    #cfg_dir=/opt/nagios/etc/servers

    #cfg_dir=/opt/nagios/etc/printers

    #cfg_dir=/opt/nagios/etc/switches

    #cfg_dir=/opt/nagios/etc/routers





    # OBJECT CACHE FILE

    # This option determines where object definitions are cached when

    # Nagios starts/restarts.  The CGIs read object definitions from

    # this cache file (rather than looking at the object config files

    # directly) in order to prevent inconsistencies that can occur

    # when the config files are modified after Nagios starts.


    object_cache_file=/opt/nagios/var/objects.cache




    # PRE-CACHED OBJECT FILE

    # This options determines the location of the precached object file.

    # If you run Nagios with the -p command line option, it will preprocess

    # your object configuration file(s) and write the cached config to this

    # file.  You can then start Nagios with the -u option to have it read

    # object definitions from this precached file, rather than the standard

    # object configuration files (see the cfg_file and cfg_dir options above).

    # Using a precached object file can speed up the time needed to (re)start

    # the Nagios process if you've got a large and/or complex configuration.

    # Read the documentation section on optimizing Nagios to find our more

    # about how this feature works.


    precached_object_file=/opt/nagios/var/objects.precache




    # RESOURCE FILE

    # This is an optional resource file that contains $USERx$ macro

    # definitions. Multiple resource files can be specified by using

    # multiple resource_file definitions.  The CGIs will not attempt to

    # read the contents of resource files, so information that is

    # considered to be sensitive (usernames, passwords, etc) can be

    # defined as macros in this file and restrictive permissions (600)

    # can be placed on this file.


    resource_file=/opt/nagios/etc/resource.cfg




    # STATUS FILE

    # This is where the current status of all monitored services and

    # hosts is stored.  Its contents are read and processed by the CGIs.

    # The contents of the status file are deleted every time Nagios

    #  restarts.


    status_file=/opt/nagios/var/status.dat




    # STATUS FILE UPDATE INTERVAL

    # This option determines the frequency (in seconds) that

    # Nagios will periodically dump program, host, and

    # service status data.


    status_update_interval=10




    # NAGIOS USER

    # This determines the effective user that Nagios should run as.

    # You can either supply a username or a UID.


    nagios_user=nagios




    # NAGIOS GROUP

    # This determines the effective group that Nagios should run as.

    # You can either supply a group name or a GID.


    nagios_group=nagios




    # EXTERNAL COMMAND OPTION

    # This option allows you to specify whether or not Nagios should check

    # for external commands (in the command file defined below).\ 

    # By default Nagios will check for external commands.

    # If you want to be able to use the CGI command interface

    # you will have to enable this.

    # Values: 0 = disable commands, 1 = enable commands


    check_external_commands=1




    # EXTERNAL COMMAND FILE

    # This is the file that Nagios checks for external command requests.

    # It is also where the command CGI will write commands that are submitted

    # by users, so it must be writeable by the user that the web server

    # is running as (usually 'nobody').  Permissions should be set at the

    # directory level instead of on the file, as the file is deleted every

    # time its contents are processed.


    command_file=/opt/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd




    # QUERY HANDLER INTERFACE

    # This is the socket that is created for the Query Handler interface


    #query_socket=/opt/nagios/var/rw/nagios.qh




    # LOCK FILE

    # This is the lockfile that Nagios will use to store its PID number

    # in when it is running in daemon mode.


    lock_file=/run/nagios.lock




    # TEMP FILE

    # This is a temporary file that is used as scratch space when Nagios

    # updates the status log, cleans the comment file, etc.  This file

    # is created, used, and deleted throughout the time that Nagios is

    # running.


    temp_file=/opt/nagios/var/nagios.tmp




    # TEMP PATH

    # This is path where Nagios can create temp files for service and

    # host check results, etc.


    temp_path=/tmp




    # EVENT BROKER OPTIONS

    # Controls what (if any) data gets sent to the event broker.

    # Values:  0      = Broker nothing

    #         -1      = Broker everything

    #         <other> = See documentation


    event_broker_options=-1




    # EVENT BROKER MODULE(S)

    # This directive is used to specify an event broker module that should

    # by loaded by Nagios at startup.  Use multiple directives if you want

    # to load more than one module.  Arguments that should be passed to

    # the module at startup are separated from the module path by a space.

    #

    #!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    # WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING

    #!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    #

    # Do NOT overwrite modules while they are being used by Nagios or Nagios

    # will crash in a fiery display of SEGFAULT glory.  This is a bug/limitation

    # either in dlopen(), the kernel, and/or the filesystem.  And maybe Nagios...

    #

    # The correct/safe way of updating a module is by using one of these methods:

    #    1. Shutdown Nagios, replace the module file, restart Nagios

    #    2. Delete the original module file, move the new module file into place,

    #\trestart Nagios

    #

    # Example:

    #

    #   broker_module=<modulepath> [moduleargs]


    #broker_module=/somewhere/module1.o

    #broker_module=/somewhere/module2.o arg1 arg2=3 debug=0




    # LOG ROTATION METHOD

    # This is the log rotation method that Nagios should use to rotate

    # the main log file. Values are as follows..

    #\tn\t= None - don't rotate the log

    #\th\t= Hourly rotation (top of the hour)

    #\td\t= Daily rotation (midnight every day)

    #\tw\t= Weekly rotation (midnight on Saturday evening)

    #\tm\t= Monthly rotation (midnight last day of month)


    log_rotation_method=d




    # LOG ARCHIVE PATH

    # This is the directory where archived (rotated) log files should be

    # placed (assuming you've chosen to do log rotation).


    log_archive_path=/opt/nagios/var/archives

    # to 1.


    log_event_handlers=1




    # INITIAL STATES LOGGING OPTION

    # If you want Nagios to log all initial host and service states to

    # the main log file (the first time the service or host is checked)

    # you can enable this option by setting this value to 1.  If you

    # are not using an external application that does long term state

    # statistics reporting, you do not need to enable this option.  In

    # this case, set the value to 0.


    log_initial_states=0




    # CURRENT STATES LOGGING OPTION

    # If you don't want Nagios to log all current host and service states

    # FLAP DETECTION OPTION

    # This option determines whether or not Nagios will try

    # and detect hosts and services that are \"flapping\".

    # Flapping occurs when a host or service changes between

    # states too frequently.  When Nagios detects that a

    # host or service is flapping, it will temporarily suppress

    # notifications for that host/service until it stops

    # flapping.  Flap detection is very experimental, so read

    # the HTML documentation before enabling this feature!

    # TIMEZONE OFFSET

    # This option is used to override the default timezone that this

    # instance of Nagios runs in.  If not specified, Nagios will use

    # the system configured timezone.

    #

    # NOTE: In order to display the correct timezone in the CGIs, you

    # will also need to alter the Apache directives for the CGI path

    # to include your timezone.  Example:

    #

    #   <Directory \"/usr/local/nagios/sbin/\">

    #      SetEnv TZ \"Australia/Brisbane\"

    # handlers, etc.  This DOES NOT affect macros used in service or

    # host check commands.

    # The following macros are stripped of the characters you specify:

    # REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING

    # This option controls whether or not regular expression matching

    # takes place in the object config files.  Regular expression

    # matching is used to match host, hostgroup, service, and service

    # group names/descriptions in some fields of various object types.

    # \"TRUE\" REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING

    # This option controls whether or not \"true\" regular expression

    # matching takes place in the object config files.  This option

    # only has an effect if regular expression matching is enabled

    # (see above).  If this option is DISABLED, regular expression

    # matching only occurs if a string contains wildcard characters

    # (* and ?).  If the option is ENABLED, regexp matching occurs

    # DAEMON CORE DUMP OPTION

    # This option determines whether or not Nagios is allowed to create

    # a core dump when it runs as a daemon.  Note that it is generally

    # considered bad form to allow this, but it may be useful for

    # debugging purposes.  Enabling this option doesn't guarantee that

    # a core file will be produced, but that's just life...

    # LARGE INSTALLATION TWEAKS OPTION

    # This option determines whether or not Nagios will take some shortcuts

    # which can save on memory and CPU usage in large Nagios installations.

    # This option determines whether or not Nagios will make all standard

    # macros available as environment variables when host/service checks

    # and system commands (event handlers, notifications, etc.) are

    # executed.

    # Enabling this is a very bad idea for anything but very small setups,

    # as it means plugins, notification scripts and eventhandlers may run

    # out of environment space. It will also cause a significant increase

    # in CPU- and memory usage and drastically reduce the number of checks

    # you can run.

    # Values: 1 - Enable environment variable macros

    #         0 - Disable environment variable macros (default)


    enable_environment_macros=0




    # CHILD PROCESS MEMORY OPTION

    # This option determines whether or not Nagios will free memory in

    # child processes (processed used to execute system commands and host/

    # service checks).  If you specify a value here, it will override

    # program defaults.

    # Value: 1 - Free memory in child processes

    #        0 - Do not free memory in child processes


    #free_child_process_memory=1




    # CHILD PROCESS FORKING BEHAVIOR

    # This option determines how Nagios will fork child processes

    # (used to execute system commands and host/service checks).  Normally

    # child processes are fork()ed twice, which provides a very high level

    # of isolation from problems.  Fork()ing once is probably enough and will

    # save a great deal on CPU usage (in large installs), so you might

    # want to consider using this.  If you specify a value here, it will
